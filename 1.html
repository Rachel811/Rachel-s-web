<h2> History of South Korea</h2>
<p>
  According to the mythic account recounted in the Samguk yusa (1280s), the Gojoseon (Old Joseon) kingdom was founded in northern Korea and southern Manchuria in 2333 BC.</p><p>[8][9][10] The Gija Joseon state was purportedly founded in 12th century BC. Its existence and role has been controversial in the modern era, and seen as likely mythology.[11] The first written historical record on Gojoseon can be found from the early 7th century BC.[12][13] The Jin state was formed in southern Korea by the 3rd century BC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Korea" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank">In the 2nd century BC</a>, Gija Joseon was replaced by Wiman Joseon, which fell to the Han dynasty of China near the end of the century</p> <img src="Korea.jpg"width="30%"> <br>This resulted in the fall of Gojoseon and led to succeeding warring states, the Protoâ€“Three Kingdoms period that spanned the later Iron Age.
